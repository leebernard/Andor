This is a repository for code using the Software Development Kit for 
the Andor iXon Ultra camera

The code here is for taking data in a known, trustworthy fashion, 
for data reduction purposes, while the interface is being developed. 
Thus, all the code in here is one-off stuff, not intended for general 
use. If you pull from the repository, you deserve what you get.
